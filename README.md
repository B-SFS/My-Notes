## As a Developer here are some **Tips** to make you a better Developer :
1. **Conceiving The Purpose of Software** : That means You should understand the purpose of the software that you want to make by asking your self some questions like how can my software help users if you get a full answer for this question then your are good to go to next step.

2. **Mentioning the goals for your software** :You should design a system that can be created and maintained as easily as possible  for the developer and easy to use for the user.

3. **(Mis)understanding** : You should Understand Your system really good because if you not you will develop a complex system witch is not good for the user and for the programmer who will change the code after you.

4. **Simplicity** : When ever your code is simple it is much better than making your code complex to be said that your are smart or you are writing  a good code the simplicity is to write a code that is readable from the junior and senior developer.

5. **Complexity** : You should always be aware of making your code or your software complex because whenever you made it complex you will face a lot of bugs and these bugs need to be solved to continue your work and this will take from you time and effort.

6. **Maintenance** : Maintenance is one of the most important things in software development and you shouldn't ignore this process 
so if your code was so comlex and it is not simplicity this will make and issue for the maintenance team because they need to understand your code first because you didn't take the (Simplicty and the Complixity tips in your mind ) so this will late the project.
 
7. **Consistency** : If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place. For example, if you name a variable thisIsVariable, then all of your variables should be named like this (camelCase way).

8. **Solving Problems** : If you faced any problem , just write the problem on a peace of paper and try to think about how i can solve this problem and if you can't solve it read the next tip because it will help you. 

9. **Don't ask for the problem solve , ask for help** : this means that don't ask for the answer for this problem ask for some requirements that will help you solve the problem this will learn you how to think in a correct way.

10. **Use the Documentation and Commenting in Your code** : this will help the maintaince team to understand your code easier and faster that it should without the commenting and documentation even if there is no team it is just you this will help you very much in remebring your code and it will make you be able to change it easily.

11. **Running Away From Rewriting** : don't write the code from Scratch ,Imagine that you are working with a team and your teammate send you the code to start working with it don't rewrite the code from begining just because you don't have the ability to read and understand your teammate code try your best to understand the code perfectly and this is a skill that you will earn when you tracks the code ,this will really help you in future to track the errors and bugs.
